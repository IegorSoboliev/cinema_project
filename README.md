This is a template for creating an e-cinema. Application is built on REST principles. You can use 
Postman for testing it.

Every user can register according to constraints for email an password, then see all available 
movies, choose a movie-session and order a ticket. 

There are specific tools for admins only to allow them adding movies, movie-sessions and 
cinemahalls.
