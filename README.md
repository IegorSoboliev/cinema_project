# My cinema_project



# Purpose
This is a template for creating an e-cinema. 

Every user can register according to constraints for email and password, then see all available 
movies, choose a movie-session and order a ticket. 

There are specific tools for admins only to allow them adding movies, movie-sessions and 
cinemahalls.
